Here are our second ***group work codes!!!*** 

**To be honest**, the readability of codes is actually not very well (lol).

Well, if I have enough time, I will add more annotation in the future (<font color=Blue>PERHAPS</font>).

Also, by the way, to run the codes successfully, [EasyX](https://easyx.cn/) library is also **essential!!!**
